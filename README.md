# Analyzing-Fuel-Economy-Trends-and-Predicting-Smartway-vehicles
# Introduction

Welcome to the Fuel Economy of Cars Project! This project aims to analyze and predict the fuel efficiency of various car models using advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques. The goal is to provide insights into the factors affecting fuel economy and develop predictive models for better decision-making in the automotive industry.

# Features

# Data Analysis:

Detailed exploration and treatment of data, including handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing duplicate rows.

# Clustering Analysis:

Identifying and analyzing clusters within the dataset to uncover distinct patterns.

# Predictive Modeling:

Developing models to predict SmartWay certification and City MPG.

# Visualization:

Creating visualizations to communicate changes and trends in car features and fuel economy over 10 years.

# Data Analysis Steps

Number of Samples in Each Year: Analyzing the distribution of samples across different years.
Number of Columns in Each Dataset: Ensuring consistency in column counts after merging datasets.
Duplicate Rows: Identifying and handling duplicate entries.
Data Types: Verifying and correcting data types of columns.
Missing Values: Identifying and treating missing values appropriately.
Unique Values: Analyzing unique values and their counts for each feature.
Group Analysis: Grouping data by certain features to uncover insights.

# Clustering Analysis

Using the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters and analyzing the properties of each cluster to identify distinct groups of vehicles based on their characteristics.

# Predictive Modeling

SmartWay Certification Prediction: Using Logistic Regression and Decision Tree algorithms to predict SmartWay certification. Comparing models to determine the best performer.

# City MPG Prediction:

Developing a regression model to predict City MPG using the best features identified during analysis.

# Results

Model Comparison for SmartWay Certification: Presenting accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for both Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models.

City MPG Prediction: Evaluating the regression model based on Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared values.
